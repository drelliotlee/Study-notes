**(Tentative) Plan:**
- AI/ML Refresher
	- Classical/Tabular ML
		- Prerequisites
			- pandas
			- sqlalchemy
			- pyarrow
		- Top Models
			- scikit-learn
			- xgboost
			- lightgbm
			- catboost
		- Feature Engineering
			- featuretools
			- category_encoders
			- imbalanced-learn
		- Model Evaluation
			- metrics: scikit-learn

			- residual analysis, diagnostics: statsmodels
		- Data checks
			- Data quality checks: great expectations, pandera
			- Drift & integrity monitoring: deepchecks, evidently
		- Train/validation/test splitting data
			- random vs stratified (scikit-learn)
			- cross-validation (train_test_split w scikit-learn)
			- avoiding leakage (sklearn.pipeline & ColumnTransformer)
			- time-series splits w sliding windows (tcsv or sktime)
		- experiment tracking
			- logging parameters, metrics, artifacts, compare runs (mlflow)
			- weights and biases dashboards (wandb)
			- another tracker? (neptune.ai)
		- Reproducibility and Model Packaging
			- Environment & Dependencies: poetry, pip-tools, conda, mamba
			- Config mgmt: hydra
			- Serialization/export: joblib, onnx
			- Containerization: docker
			- Serving: fastapi
	- Neural Nets

**Organization**
`/home/elliot/Dropbox/Obsidian/STUDY` daily notes, synced with `study sync`

`/home/elliot/Repos` is where all my code will go

`https://github.com/drelliotlee` is the github account for everything

Anki for things that require memorization

----

**What I did today**
- Set up my github repos locally and remotely
- Set up my study notes vault in Obsidian (daily notes framework)
